{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"name":"Marco Novo","rank":5,"active":true,"image":"/influencers/marco.jpeg","bio":"Live streamer since 2015, with a marketing background. Amazon creator since 2021, with around 400 live shows made. \"Traveled\" all around the world through live streaming and my guests from 30+ different countries, and 5 continents, allowing Marco and his audience to learn, build trust, and get engaged. Being born in a small Portuguese town, was not a problem, when you combine curiosity, craziness, and will. In this journey, Marco became one of the fewest European Amazon influencers and even the fewest non-native English speaker and worked with brands like Sennheiser, Renpho, Heil Sound, Streamyard, Invideo, among others. Marco truly believes that live streaming is an amazing way to get known, build trust, and even more important, know and understand your audience to turn them into customers and ultimately, ambassadors. Besides this, he speaks Portuguese, Spanish, and English, loves sports, playing padel, European football, and futsal, loves to walk by the sea, and meanwhile, takes some photos of the sunset at the ocean.","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/mfcnovo","website":"https://www.amazon.com/shop/mfcnovo","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/@marcotingreviews"},"reactiveContent":null}},"__N_SSG":true}
