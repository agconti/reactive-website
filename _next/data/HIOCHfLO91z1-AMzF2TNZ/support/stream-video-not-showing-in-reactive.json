Make sure your *Stream Key* and *Server URL* are correct.\nMake sure you have the used the correct Reactive *Stream Key* and *Server URL* in your streaming software settings. You may still be using an old Reactive *Stream Key* or the *Stream Key* may have been reset due to updating a setting in the Reactive app.![Stream Key and Server URL](/blog-assets/support-assets/video-not-showing/stream-key.png)\n\n### 1. Make sure you inputed your *Stream Key* and *Server URL* correctly.\nBe sure that you didn't accidentally input the Reactive *Stream Key* where the *Server URL* goes and vice verca within your live streaming software settings.\n\n### 2. Make sure you have a strong internet connection.\nIf your internet connection is week, Reactive may not be able to process your live stream since a week internet connection can cause intermittent breaks in video data transfer. If you are using OBS you can easily see the status of the data transfer in the bottom right. If the status is *orange* or *red*, you likely have a weak internet connection or no internet connection. If the status is *green*, then you likely have a strong internet connection and the issue is being caused elsewhere.![Stream Key and Server URL](/blog-assets/support-assets/video-not-showing/connection-status.png)\n\n\n## What to do if none of the above solved the issue.\nIf none of the above solved the issue, there is a chance that Reactive is experiencing an outage.
