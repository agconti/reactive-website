Type the product name in the search\nShopify only allows apps to load 50 products at a time. If you have more than 50 products for your Shopify store you will need to search for the product by name. Simply type the name of the product in the search bar and reactive will automatically load any products that match.\n![Search for the product by name](/blog-assets/support-assets/cannot-find-product/product-search.png) \n\n## 2. Make sure the product is published for use in Reactive\nBy default, all of your products are published for use in the Reactive Live Shopping when the app is installed. However, if you recently added a new product to your store, you may not have published it for use in the Reactive app. Publishing to Reactive is easy:\n\n1. Log into Shopify and select Products in the sidebar menu.![Visit products page](/blog-assets/support-assets/cannot-find-product/products-page.png)\n2. Search for the product you want to publish by typing the name in the *\"Filter products\"* search bar.![Search for the product by name](/blog-assets/support-assets/cannot-find-product/search-for-product.png)\n3. Check the box next to the product, click *\"More actions\"* and select *\"Add available channel(s)\"* in the dropdown menu.![Select product, click more actions, and select add to available channels](/blog-assets/support-assets/cannot-find-product/select-product.png)\n4. Make sure the box next to *\"Reactive Live Shopping\"* is checked then click *\"Make products available\"* to publish.![Select Reactive Live Shopping and publish](/blog-assets/support-assets/cannot-find-product/publish.png)\n5. You should now be able to successfully search for the product in the Reactive app.\n\nIf you are still unable to resolve the issue after trying the above, please reach out to [support@reactive.live](mailto:support@reactive.live) and a representative will assist you.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
