By default, content plays on every page of your site, but we make it easy to limit which pages content will play on if you desire.\n\n**To choose what pages your live event plays on**: begin a new Reactive Stream. Click the \"Settings\" tab in the top right corner.\n\n![](/blog-assets/live-settings-tab.png)\n\nFind the \"Content Visibility\" settings:\n\n![](/blog-assets/live-content-visibility-settings.png)\n\n**To choose what pages your shoppable video plays on:** find the video in the home view and click on it.\n\n![](/blog-assets/click-replay-details.png)\n\nNext, click the \"Settings\" tab in the left-hand navigation panel. Find the \"Content Visibility\" settings.\n\n![](/blog-assets/replay-plays-on-pages-settings.png)\n\nTo set which page(s) you want the stream to play on, you must input a phrase(no spaces) that is included in the page URL. For example, the phrase `summer-collection` would play on:\n\n* https://mystore.com/**summer-collection**/123/dress\n* https://mystore.com/2022/**summer-collection**/landing\n\nIt would NOT play on:\n\n* https://mystore.com/summer/collection/123\n* https://mystore.com/summer/2022/collection/landing\n\nThe phrase `summer` would play on all:\n\n* https://mystore.com/**summer**-collection/123/dress\n* https://mystore.com/2022/**summer**-collection/landing\n* https://mystore.com/**summer**/collection/123\n* https://mystore.com/**summer**/2022/collection/landing\n\nFinally, make sure to save the phrase by clicking the save button."},"__N_SSG":true}
