Supported webstores are BigCommerce, Shopify, Magento and WooCommerce.\n\nHow does it work? LitCommerce copies products from your webstore to Shopify and orders from Shopify to your webstore. Reactive showcases products in your webstore that have been copied to Shopify.  Tax, shipping, and credit cards are processed by Shopify.  LitCommerce copies orders from Shopify to your webstore and your webstore fullfills the orders. The Reactive embed is added to your webstore to show the Reactive livestream on your webstore.  \n\n**Installation Instructions:** The following instructions create the Shopify store, setup LitCommerce to copy products and orders between your webstore and Shopify, and adds the Reactive Embed to your webstore.\n\n\n### 1. Create a Shopify Store\nUse this link and sign up for a [Shopify Starter plan](https://www.shopify.com/starter). ![alt_text](/blog-assets/support-assets/how-to-add-other-webstores/shopifystarterplan.png)\n\n### 2. Add Reactive Live Shopping to your Shopify store\nFollow this link and add the [Reactive live shopping channel](https://apps.shopify.com/reactive) in your Shopify site.\n\n### 3. Create a LitCommerce account\nCreate a sign in to[ LitCommerce](https://litcommerce.com) and sign up for the *\"Basic Plan\"* or higher.\n\n### 4.

On the *\"Source Store Setup\"* Page, choose your eCommerce platform. LitCommerce currently supports BigCommerce, Shopify, Magento and WooCommerce.![alt_text](/blog-assets/support-assets/how-to-add-other-webstores/Set-up-Source-Cart.png)\n2.

For example, BigCommerce needs *API Path*, *Client ID* and *API Token*.\n3. If you want to connect your WooCommerce store, please install the LitCommerce plugin by logging in to your WooCommerce dashboard and go to *Plugins* > *Add New* and search for LitCommerce.

Sync Inventory from your Main Store and with Inventory Rules\nWith inventory sync turned on, LitCommerce will automatically update the inventory quantity on your Shopify store to match with the quantity in your LitCommerce central catalog. Every time there is a new order on Shopify, the inventory quantity will decrease according to the amount ordered and will be updated on the Main store. This way you can always display the correct quantity for every product to avoid overselling.\n\nHowever, you should note that the synchronization doesn’t work the other way around. If you update the inventory quantity directly on Shopify, the changes will not appear in your LitCommerce account.\n\nYou cannot make changes to the quantity in your LitCommerce central catalog as well. If you want to modify the quantity, please go to your Main store account and adjust the quantity there. After that, LitCommerce will update in the central catalog to match with the quantity in your Main store catalog.\n\n1. Under Listing on the right, select your Shopify store\n2.
