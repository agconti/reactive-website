Sure you do!  \nAnd you probably have:  \na) a website that consumers visit  \nb) various social media channels that you use often and that have a following  \nc) a consumers’ database  \n  \nFab! 💡 Start there. Market your live shopping show in the channels you have (website, socials, email, sms, EVERYTHING/EVERYWHERE!!) & let your audience know in advance what you are planning to do.  \nRemind them a few days before the show AND ASK THEM to register for the show! 👨‍💻  \nThen send them a reminder 1h to 30 min before you kick off!  \n  \n2️⃣ Do you as a brand have a budget for paid traffic? YES, you do!  \nThen shoot some ads to the internet with your live show info & a registration form. 🚀 Of course, make sure you’re targeting the right audience.  \n  \n3️⃣ Do you as a brand lack consistent traffic to your website, have no online community on socials or simply want to reach a new audience from the start? 🤯  \nWell, this is the pricey option of course but, if this is your case, make use of retail media or a high quality influencer who can act as host & leverage the traffic they already have!  \n  \nSee? It was easier than you’d expect! But of course the work needs to be planned and most importantly done right! 😍 - and this is obvs what we at [FREIM Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearefreim/) are here for, to make your life easy! -  \n  \nWould you want to know what are the other two questions everyone asks about Live Shopping? 🤓"},"__N_SSG":true}
