First you will need to start start a live stream in Reactive.\n2. Before you switch on *GO-LIVE*, you will want to configure the *\"Display on pages\"* option in the *Stream Information* panel to limit the live stream to a single page. ![Display on pages input](/blog-assets/support-assets/how-to-replay-a-stream-on-a-product-page-in-shopify/display-pages-input.png) To do this you will want to copy the `/products/[product-name]` part of the url for the product page you wish the stream to play on. An example is shown below: ![Copy the product path](/blog-assets/support-assets/how-to-replay-a-stream-on-a-product-page-in-shopify/copy-part-of-address.png)\n3. You will then need to paste the copied part of the url into the *\"Display on pages\"* input field and click the *check mark* button to save. ![Paste and save](/blog-assets/support-assets/how-to-replay-a-stream-on-a-product-page-in-shopify/save-phrase.png) The example shown will only play on pages with a URL containing `/products/summer-sandal`. This includes any product variant pages with urls formatted as either `/products/summer-sandal?variant=42598373064920` or `/products/summer-sandal-yellow`.\n4. Next you will switch on *GO-LIVE* to begin live streaming on your site. This will also begin the recording of your content.\n5. When you have finished streaming live, click the *\"End Stream\"* button, and you will be redirected to the Reactive Home screen.\n6. On the Reactive Home screen, your live stream will appear at the top of the *\"Recorded Streams\"* list, and when you click the *\"Replay on Site\"* button for that stream, your recorded live event will only play for customers who visit the page you originally live streamed on. ![Replay on site](/blog-assets/support-assets/how-to-replay-a-stream-on-a-product-page-in-shopify/replay-on-site.png)\n\n----\n\nWe are always looking for ways to improve our products to make your Live selling experience as smooth as possible.
