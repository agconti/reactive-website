That may include partnering with an influencer or celebrity to host a live shopping event on a brand’s website. Live selling has become increasingly popular in recent years and has proven to be a transformative and overwhelmingly effective strategy for e-commerce store owners. Do you work for an ecommerce company or marketing agency?\n\nHere is what you need to know about live shopping in 2023:\n\n### 1. The rest of the world already loves it\n\nLive shopping is a huge market in other parts of the world.
