Reactiveâ€™s Gift Drop feature is the answer.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nGift drop works by randomly giving a chosen amount of audience members an exclusive discount to use in the stream. These discounts are more effective than traditional discounts because they're single-use and can't be stolen by other users or used in unintended ways.\n\nGift drop is more effective than traditional discounts because it allows merchants to increase the volume of sales driven while only reducing the price for a small portion of users.
