Drive more sales while maximizing revenue!\n\nTraditional discounts (symmetric discounts) drive all customers to purchase by reducing the cost of the product. As a merchant, you bet that increase in purchase volume offsets the price drop. However, this often doesnâ€™t happen, see [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agconti_ecommerce-conversionoptimization-conversionrateoptimization-activity-6960214292340076544-LwoH.).\n\nTo improve on this, Reactive introduces asymmetric discounts with our gift drop and discount grab features. Asymmetric discounts drive sales by giving discounts to only a fraction of users and use the social proof and FOMO generated by their purchase to increase sales volume. You get more sales at a higher average price point and create the impulse buy all brands seek.\n\n![asymmetric-discounts.mp4](/blog-assets/asymmetric-discounts.mp4 \"asymmetric-discounts.mp4\")","posts":[{"slug":"tired-of-low-conversion-rates-and-wish-you-could-gamify-purchasing-try-reactive-s-discount-grab","frontmatter":{"date":"2022-10-12","title":" Discount grab: increase conversion through gamified purchasing live shopping events.
